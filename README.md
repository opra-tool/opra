    <b>Online tool for the prediction of room acoustical qualities</b>
</p>

<br>
<br>


This application calculates acoustical parameters from room impulse responses, primarily from ISO 3382-1[^1], Soulodre & Bradley[^2] and L.L. Beranek[^3].
It is in parts based on an earlier implemented Matlab tool[^4].
The accompanying masters thesis goes into detail about calculation methods used in this application[^5].

Both tools were programmed at the [Institute of Sound and Vibration Engineering​ (ISAVE)](https://isave.hs-duesseldorf.de/), which is part of the [Hochschule Düsseldorf](https://hs-duesseldorf.de/).

## Staging Environment

A staging environment reflecting the current state of the `main` branch is availabe at [raqi-staging.paulschwoerer.de](https://raqi-staging.paulschwoerer.de/).

## Test files

A large collection of room impulse responses can be at [github.com/RoyJames/room-impulse-responses](https://github.com/RoyJames/room-impulse-responses).

## Development Quickstart

To get started:

```sh
# requires rust, cargo and wasm-pack
cd wasm
wasm-pack build --target web

# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
npm install
npm run start
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs the app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs the app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds the app and outputs it in the `dist` directory
- `test` runs the test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for the project

## Localization

Localization is implemented using [lit-localize](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/).
To extract strings needing localization, run

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/lit-localize extract
```

Then edit `xliff/[lang].xlf` until you're happy with the results.
To include translations back into the application, run

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/lit-localize build
```

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in the project.
